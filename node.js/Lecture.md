# Server

Every frontend app is connected to a server where data is stored.
Whenever we request a POST from frontend the data is sent to the server.
In the server there is hard drive which has a database i.e software. Inside the server our front end data gets stored. In response the server send a response of 201 data stored successfully. This is called client server communication.
Servers are machine having powerful processor. Any computer/laptop could act as a server, but there is a problem, when traffic on the website increases it won't work. Therefor we use servers

# API

Everything has a User Interface with which a user could use/control a device or machine by giving some instructions. e.g: Washing Machine, Oven, Laptop
This interface has a Graphical version which is called GUI.
User Interface is for communication between human and machine. But when a computer needs to communicate with another computer then its called Programming Interface.
